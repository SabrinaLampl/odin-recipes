<p><h2>It takes a little work, but it is worth it.</h2></p>

<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ground Beef</li>
  <li>Minced Onion</li>
  <li>Garlic</li>
  <li>Tomato Paste</li>
  <li>Basil Leaves</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>For the pasta dough: Steam the spinach in a steamer or over boiling water until bright green, 2 minutes. Squeeze to remove excess moisture and process in a food processor to make a paste. Combine spinach with eggs, semolina, and salt and process until smooth. Stir in enough of the flour to make a smooth dough. Knead briefly, cover and set aside.</li>
  <li>For the bechamel: While the ragu is simmering, combine 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons flour in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk to make a roux. Remove from heat, let rest one minute, then whisk in warm milk. Return to heat, simmer 10 minutes, stirring constantly, until thickened. Season with salt and nutmeg. Remove from heat.</li>
  <li>To cook pasta: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. On a floured surface, divide pasta dough into three portions. Roll each portion out to a thin sheet. Have ready an ice water bath. Cook each sheet 3 minutes in the boiling water; remove from the boiling water and dip in the ice water; drain and dry on a clean, dry cloth.</li>
  <li>To finish the ragu: Stir the chicken livers into the simmering sauce. Cook 1 minute, remove from heat and set aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 baking dish.</li>
  <li>To assemble lasagna: Place one pasta sheet in bottom of prepared baking dish. Spread one-third of the ragu, one-quarter of the bechamel, one-third of the ricotta, and one-quarter of the parmesan over the pasta. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining bechamel and parmesan and dot with butter.</li>
  <li>Bake in preheated oven 30 minutes, until top is golden brown.</li>
